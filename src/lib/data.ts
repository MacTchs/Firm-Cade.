    excerpt: "Android 16 has already reached the final stages of development and the final release is just a few weeks away.",
    content: `
      <h2> With this earlier-than-usual number update to Android, Google is focusing mostly on under-the-hood improvements and practical improvements.
       Private Space and partial screen recording were added to Android 15, despite the fact that the update's visual improvements received little attention. </h2>
       <p>
       This year, too, Google doesn’t seem too keen to focus much on a radical aesthetic overhaul.
       If you are curious about the update, here is everything you must know about Android 16, including when it will be available, which devices already have it, and which features are likely to make it to the final release. </p>

       <p>Google released the Android 16 developer previews and beta months ahead of the usual schedule. </p>
        <p>As such, Android 16 beta 3 is already live, and we have already reached the “Platform Stability” stage, suggesting Google is only making final touch-up and fixing bugs rather than testing new features. </p>
        <p>
        This time period is for app developers to make changes. Based on the time release timeline, we expect the stable version of Android 16 to arrive sometime after April.  There is no better time than Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, which will begin on May 20 this year, even though we do not have any official statements. </p>
        Android 16 is currently only available on Pixel phones made by Google, starting with the Pixel 6 and up. Although the list may expand over the coming weeks, these phones currently support Android 16 beta if you would to try:
        <ul>
        <li>Pixel 6/6 Pro</li> 
        <li>Pixel 6a</li>
        <li>Pixel 7/7 Pro</li>
        <li>Pixel 7a</li>
        <li>Pixel Fold</li>
        <li>Pixel Tablet</li>
        <li>Pixel 8/8 Pro</li>
        <li>Pixel 8a</li>
        <li>Pixel 9 </li>
        <li>Pixel 9 Pro XL</li>
        <li>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</li>
       </ul>

       <p>
       The newly launched Pixel 9a is not officially on the list yet, but you should have no problems running the latest version of Android on it.
       If you wish to try out the Android 16 beta on your phone, head over to this link, and select the devices you wish to be updated. </p>
       <p>
       The shorter-than-usual window between the release of stable Android 15 and Android 16 builds leaves less time for several upgrades, but there are some noteworthy features we would see coming to Android this year after all.</p>

    title: "Windsurf, a startup that codes sounds, introduces its own AI models.",
    excerpt: "Windsurf, a startup that develops popular AI tools for software engineers, announced the launch of its first family of AI software engineering models, or SWE-1 for short.",

    content: `
      <h2>The startup says it trained its new family of AI models — SWE-1, SWE-1-lite, and SWE-1-mini — to be optimized for the “entire software engineering process,” not just coding.</h2>

      <p>The launch of Windsurf’s in-house AI models may come as a shock to some, given that OpenAI has reportedly closed a $3 billion deal to acquire Windsurf.</p>
      <p>
      However, the launch of this model suggests that Windsurf is attempting to develop not only applications but also the models that power them. According to Windsurf, SWE-1, the largest and most capable AI model of the bunch, performs competitively with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on internal programming benchmarks. </p>
      <p>
      However, SWE-1 appears to fall short of frontier AI models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on software engineering tasks.</p>
      Windsurf says its SWE-1-lite and SWE-1-mini models will be available for all users on itsplatform, free or paid.
      <p>
      Meanwhile, SWE-1 will only be available to paid users.  Windsurf did not immediately announce pricing for its SWE-1 models but claims it’s cheaper to serve than Claude 3.5 Sonnet. </p>

      <p>
       Windsurf is best known for tools that allow software engineers to write and edit code through conversations with an AI chatbot, a practice known as “vibe coding.” </p>
       <p>
       Other popular vibe-coding startups include Cursor, the largest in the space, as well as Lovable.  The majority of these startups, including Windsurf, have traditionally powered their applications with AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. </p>
       <p>
       In a video announcing the SWE models, comments made by Windsurf’s Head of Research, Nicholas Moy, underscore Windsurf’s newest efforts to differentiate its approach. </p>
       <p>
      “Today’s frontier models are optimized for coding, and they’ve made massive strides over the last couple of years,” says Moy.  “But they’re not enough for us … Coding is not software engineering.”
      </p>

      <p>
      Windsurf notes in a blog post that while other models are good at writing code, they struggle to work between multiple surfaces — as programmers often do — such as terminals, IDEs, and the internet. </p>
      <p>
      The startup says SWE-1 was trained using a new data model and a “training recipe that encapsulates incomplete states, long-running tasks, and multiple surfaces.”

    title: "Trump floats possible new F-55 warplane and F-22 upgrade",
    excerpt: "The United States is examining development of a twin-engined warplane to be known as the F-55",

    content: `
    <h2>The United States is examining development of a twin-engined warplane to be known as the F-55, as well as an upgrade to its Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), opens new tab F-22 Raptor called the F-22 Super, U.S.</h2>
    <p>
    Trump was speaking at a meeting of business leaders including the heads of Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab and GE Aerospace (GE.N), opens new tab in Doha, a day after announcing a string of business deals including an order from Qatar for 160 Boeing commercial jets. </p>
    <p>
    After losing out to Boeing to replace the F-22 superfighter, Trump appeared to echo Lockheed's talk of a "best value" alternative and referred to the F-55 as both an upgrade to the F-35 and a new development. </p>
    <p>
    He also highlighted the role of the new air dominance platform called the F-47, recently awarded to Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab, and said the United States was simultaneously looking at upgrading the stealth fighter that it is designed to replace, the F-22. </p>
    <p>
    "We're going to do an F-55 and - I think, if we get the right price, we have to get the right price - that'll be two engines and a super upgrade on the F-35, and then we're going to do the F-22," Trump said.</p>
    <p>
    "I think the most beautiful fighter jet in the world is the F-22 but we're going to do an F-22 Super and it'll be a very modern version of the F-22 fighter jet," he said. <br>
    He added, "We're going to be going with it pretty quickly." Trump last month awarded Boeing the contract for the F-47 - a replacement for the Lockheed F-22 stealth fighter featuring a crewed aircraft flanked by a cohort of drones and seen as America's most advanced or sixth-generation fighter. </p>
    <p>
    Lockheed Martin, which lost out to Boeing in that Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) competition and was dropped from a separate contest for a new U.S.  Navy stealth jet, has said it is now looking at plans for a "fifth-generation-plus" fighter. </p>

    <p>
    CEO James Taiclet told analysts last month that Lockheed was looking at ways of applying technology developed for its losing bid for the F-47 contract to the F-35, delivering 80% of the capability for half the cost. </p>
    <p>
    He stated to analysts, "We're basically going to take the chassis and turn it into a Ferrari." A Lockheed spokeswoman said "We thank President Trump for his support of the F-35 and F-22 and will continue to work closely with the Administration to realize its vision for air dominance."</p>
    <h3>'NEW AIRCRAFT'</h3>
    <p>
    Lockheed is separately in the midst of a delayed technology and software upgrade for the existing generation of F-35 strike fighter to boost cockpit displays and processing power. </p>
    <p>
    Analysts said it was not immediately clear how Trump's list of potential developments fitted into known programmes and spending plans, or the timing of existing programmes. </p>
    <p>
    According to Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst with Agency Partners, the term "F-55" could also refer to the F/A-XX program, which was designed to take over for the United States. Navy's ageing Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet with the service's own sixth-generation stealth fighter. </p>
    <p>
    Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Navy and Congress are battling the administration to keep the plans moving forward. Announcement of a winning bidder had been expected as early as March. </p>
    <p>
    Funding of the radar-evading F-22, which is designed to combat other fighters, has been fiercely debated for years as Congress blocked plans by the Air Force to speed up retirements to focus on the next generation blueprint that became the F-47.</p>
    <p>
    Any significant upgrade to the out-of-production F-22 would be costly, while Trump's reference to two engines implies the F-55 would not be a straightforward derivative of the single-engined F-35 but imply an ambitious new platform, analysts said. 
    "Adding an engine to the F-35 makes it a new aircraft," UK-based defence analyst Francis Tusa said.</p>

    excerpt: "If you squinted, you could see a shadow that looked a little bit like Florida over 2025.",

    content: `
    <h2>2025 Could easily be Nintendo's Year</h2>
    <p>
    Naturally, that was the specter of GTA 6, which was originally scheduled to launch later this year but was moved to next year, on May 26, 2026. The year could have been completely dominated by Rockstar's next epic, but the skies have cleared to let another giant release take 2025 as its own - the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>
    <p>
    Nintendo needs to make this first year of Switch 2 really matter if it wants to win in 2025. Even when you take into account major releases like Death Stranding 2, Elden Ring Nightreign, Borderlands 4, and, dare I say it, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Nintendo's new console is now the biggest launch of 2025 by quite a bit. However, with just one major launch game, the remainder of 2025 will need to be counted.</p>
    <h3>Pole position</p>
    <p>
    Switch 2 is starting strong, launching hand-in-hand with potentially the best ever Mario Kart game yet in Mario Kart World on June 5.  </p>
    <p>
    Its introduction of open-world exploration, evolution of Grand Prix races, and brand new, brilliantly chaotic Knockout Tours means that it's going to be the game everyone is talking about and sharing across their social media in June.  If it's got the staying power that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has had (it's still one of the best-selling games of all time and the best-selling Switch game), the Switch 2 is out the starting gate with a bang. </p>
    <p>
    But then, before you know it, we're into July where Nintendo has already scheduled our second big release for Switch 2 in Donkey Kong: Bananza.  Despite the brain ache it gives me every time trying to get the Bananza spelling right, this is exciting territory for DK.  It's the first 3D Donkey Kong game for 26 years (the last being Donkey Kong 64 on the N64) and from what I've played at the Switch 2 preview event, it feels like DK being given the Super Mario Odyssey treatment, to the point that if you switched out the ape for our old plumber pal you could argue it's essentially Super Mario Odyssey 2 in all but name. </p>
    <p>
    While DK's next outing isn't launching day one but on July 17, it is arriving in what we call the launch window for Switch 2, and provides an excellent excitement build just over a month after the console's debut. </p>
    That's two big exclusives within as many months for Switch 2.  And that's without even noting the big event that's happening between those two dates. </p>
    Summer Game Fest, the big June gaming industry event that's now emerged victorious from the remains of E3, is running from June 6 - 10, and usually Nintendo takes its usual slot on the Tuesday (this year being June 10) to drop a livestreamed Nintendo Direct.  It hasn't announced one yet for this year, but it's also not unlike Nintendo to drop such an event with 24-48 hours' notice. </p>
    <h3>Closing out the year</h3>
    <p>
    We have two major, undated Switch 2 exclusives that are due to launch in 2025 that may get release dates during an SGF presentation.  Knowing when Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokemon Legends: Z-A will arrive for Nintendo Switch 2 will outline the agenda for the Switch 2's first year as - hopefully - continued critically-acclaimed exclusives. </p>
    <p>
    There are also titles like Kirby Air Riders, Drag x Drive, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment still to come in 2025 that are also currently dateless and exclusive to Switch 2.  Again, they're really bolstering this first year line-up for the Switch 2 and only aiding the idea that this year could well be dominated by Nintendo releases. </p>
    <p>
    With GTA 6 now set to take over 2026, and with console exclusives for Xbox and PlayStation currently being a little scarce beyond the likes of The Outer Worlds 2 and Ghost of Yotei (at least so far), 2025 really is Nintendo's.  </p>
    <p>
    From the outline we have already for releases, it already feels like Switch 2 is the console to have in 2025.  If Nintendo can keep up with what it's already promised, it's going to be quite the first year for Switch 2
    </p>
